Technology is a big part of my life — but not the only part.

Over the last two years I’ve travelled across multiple continents, combining professional development, consulting, and personal exploration.

---

### 🌍 Travel & Culture

I enjoy long-term travel, slow exploration, and understanding how different environments shape people, systems, and decision-making.  
So far: 20+ countries — and still learning.

---

### 🏞️ Outdoors & Hiking

Whether it’s remote trails, coastlines, or mountain regions, I enjoy environments that create space for reflection, challenge, and perspective.

---

### 🌱 Volunteering & Local Initiatives

Occasionally I join environmental or community efforts — such as reforestation, pest control, and conservation programmes.

---

### 📚 Learning & Experimentation

Recently focused on:  
architecture tooling, modern cloud design approaches, leadership psychology, and applied learning through hands-on projects.

---

### 🌐 Personal Projects

This site itself is part experiment, part craft — built with **Jekyll, GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS**, and some patience.
